          <h2>Your Strategy</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Designing and implementing an effective change strategy is an agile, iterative process. The aim (and how you
            know you’ve been successful!) is high levels of end-user adoption, confidence, and usage that meet stated
            outcomes, be they related to a new system, process, reorg, or cultural shift.

          <h2>People Side of Change</h2>
          <p class="lead">Change impacts people. People - as we know - are unique, dynamic, and can change their minds
            from day-to-day. They are also notoriously resistant to changes they don’t understand, feel connected to, or
            see the value of. A meaningful and successful change strategy supports the people-side of change with a
            defined and dynamic (read: evolving) framework within the context it operates. </p>

          <h2>Key Elements</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The key elements to consider - and include - in a results-oriented change strategy are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sponsorship & Governance Model:</strong> who is championing this change? Who are the active and
              visible supporters? How engaged/available are they able to be?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communication:</strong> who are the audiences that need to be communicated with about this
              initiative? What are the key messages? How are they being communicated, by whom, and in what way?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Training/Education:</strong> what skills/knowledge do impacted end-users need to be confident and
              successful in the "new world?"" How do we provide that for them?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coaching:</strong> how comfortable/adept are your change leaders leading change? What
              support/coaching do they need to be able to advocate and sustain change, both for themselves and their
              teams?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resistance Management:</strong> how well do you know your end-users? How prepared are you to hear
              their questions, comments, and concerns about the change? Who are your biggest resistors? Do you know what
              they need?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Measurement:</strong> how do we know if we’ve been successful? How are people feeling? What are
              the stories people are telling about the change?
            </li>
          </ul>
